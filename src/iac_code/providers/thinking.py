"""Centralized thinking-mode registry keyed by (provider_key, model_name).

Two-layer registry: outer key is the provider key (matches ``auth.py``
``key_name`` and ``settings.yml`` ``providers.<key>``); inner key is the model
name. The same model name can appear under multiple providers with different
specs — e.g. ``deepseek-v4-pro`` is ``OPENAI`` family on the official DeepSeek
endpoint but ``DASHSCOPE`` family when proxied through Aliyun's compatible-mode
service.

Wire-format assembly lives in each provider subclass's
``_build_thinking_kwargs()``. This module only declares capabilities.
